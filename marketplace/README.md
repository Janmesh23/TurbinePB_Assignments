My plan to build is , mint nft via the functions provided and then transfer it via an escrow model with the program made in nft_escrow directory 
The integration of these both and final e2e testing is remaining and i will do it asap.

ps - this isn't an excuse but I have my univ final sem exams going this week , i couldn't get any time at all to do this weeks task . I am commited to complete it as soon as my exams get over
